	       <p>Mental exhaustion can lead to a decrease in cognitive performance,
	       making you more prone to mistakes and less able to process information effectively.
	       This means that even if you force yourself to study, you might not retain the information 
	       as well as you would if your brain were rested.

        <h2>Should I take a break?</h2>
		<p>Unfortunatly, time waits for no one. By the time you're done with your break, you'll feel more left behind than before.
		Long breaks can eat into your study time, reducing the overall time available for learning and potentially leading to cramming sessions later on.
		Extended breaks can disrupt the flow of study, making it harder to regain concentration and momentum once you return to your work.

        <h3>Why your brain needs a snack?</h3>
		   <p>
		       Regular snacking helps stabilize blood sugar levels, which can drop if itâ€™s been a while since your last meal.
		       Stable blood sugar levels are associated with better concentration and cognitive performance.
		       
		       A healthy adult brain is said to consume about 20% of energy a day. But University is known to stretch 
		   the brain to it's extreme, so you may never know what percentage of energy your brain is consuming.
